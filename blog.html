     I- &nbsp  mean it. Don’t learn Vue.js, React, Angular, and something else. Pick one and stick to it.
How do you select which framework to learn? Check what’s in demand in the job market you’re interested in. If there are many offers for junior Angular developers, learn Angular. If some other framework is winning, select it. If you’re not sure, bet on React.
And what about other technologies listed in job requirements? You should read something about them, but you can mostly ignore them.
Learning the basics of Git is important, but you can do it in a day or two. Styled components? If you know JavaScript and CSS, you’ll master them fast. Module bundlers? You’ll likely use starter packs long into your career.
